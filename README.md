## About

Source code for slides for talk on "Reproducible Research Data Management with DataLad" by Dr. Lennart Wittkuhn, held at the "Open Science Seminars" series at University of Mannheim on June 18th 2024 in Mannheim, Germany (virtual).

## Abstract

Inadequate reproducibility, a lack of transparency, and inefficient workflows - many scientific disciplines have a pressing need for innovation.

Additionally, the research process is becoming increasingly digital, computational, and collaborative.
I argue that technical solutions to these challenges already exist and can be found in professional software development.
These solutions primarily include tools for interactive version control of code and data, such as Git or DataLad, as well as software containers like Docker.

In this presentation, I will primarily focus on effective research data management with DataLad.
I will discuss how these tools are transforming scientific workflows and identify the (predominantly non-technical) hurdles that exist regarding their implementation.
